# Category: AI artifacts

Files that shape how agents behave in this repo: instructions, prompts, memory, project-level guidance.

## What belongs here

| Artifact | Purpose | Scope |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Shared, agent-agnostic rules | Repo |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code-specific guidance; typically references `AGENTS.md` | Repo |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot repo instructions | Repo |
| `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` | Path-scoped Copilot instructions | Repo, path-scoped |
| `.cursor/rules/` or `.cursorrules` | Cursor rules | Repo |
| `~/.codex/config.toml` | Codex CLI config | User |
| `prompts/` | Versioned prompt library | Repo |
| Skills (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`) | Reusable procedural knowledge | Repo |
| Agent memory files (`~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`) | Persistent per-project notes | User |

## Fit criteria

- **Install `AGENTS.md` when** the team uses ≥2 different agents, or you want rules to survive agent changes. Highest-leverage artifact by a wide margin — a small, clear `AGENTS.md` is the anchor everything else references.
- **Install `CLAUDE.md` when** Claude Code is a target. Keep it thin: a 1-paragraph pointer to `AGENTS.md` plus Claude-specific bits (slash commands, hooks, permissions).
- **Install Copilot instructions when** VS Code Copilot is a target. Same rule: thin, reference `AGENTS.md`.
- **Install a `prompts/` directory when** you've noticed yourself writing the same prompt repeatedly, or you're running dated work-records (like this repo's `20260422-*` prompts).
- **Install skills when** a procedure is:
  - repeatable across sessions,
  - larger than a prompt can handle,
  - specialized enough that general agents miss the nuance.

## Patterns

### Good `AGENTS.md` shape (generalizable)

```markdown
# <Project> Agent Instructions

<one-sentence what this project is>.

## Context Rules
- How agents should gather context (narrow-first, symbol-aware, etc.)
- What NOT to do (dump whole dirs, etc.)

## Project Direction
- Stack / architecture choices (only if stable)
- SDD / docs / infra conventions (only if active)

## Agent Workflow
- Where to look before implementing
- How to preserve user changes

## Current State
- What's real vs. planned
- Guidance when referenced artifacts don't yet exist
```

### Anti-patterns

- Copy-pasting the same long rules into 3 different agent files.
- `CLAUDE.md` / `copilot-instructions.md` as a dumping ground for every convention.
- Prompts that are one-offs saved "just in case" — prompts should be durable.
- Skills that are actually prompts (one-shot, non-repeatable).

## Recommend when

| User situation | Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------|
| No agent files at all | `AGENTS.md` first, then `CLAUDE.md` or Copilot pointer depending on detected agent |
| `AGENTS.md` exists, but no `CLAUDE.md` and Claude Code is a target | Thin `CLAUDE.md` that imports from `AGENTS.md` |
| Multiple agent files drifting | Consolidate rules into `AGENTS.md`, thin out the rest |
| Same prompt written repeatedly | Factor into `prompts/` with a dated filename, or a skill if procedural |

## Install sketch

Use the templates in [../../assets/templates/](../../assets/templates/). Apply:

1. Confirm the git tree is clean (or diffs are intentional) so the change is revertable.
2. Write or merge the template content.
3. Have the user review the diff before commit.
4. Validate: cat the file, make sure it's < ~150 lines (always-loaded context budget).
